‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Deployment Issue in Streamlit Cloud
While the core functionality of this tool works as intended locally, there is a known deployment issue in Streamlit Cloud related to the use of FFmpeg, which is required for audio extraction from video files (e.g., .mp4, .m4a).

üõ†Ô∏è Root of the Issue:
Streamlit Cloud does not include FFmpeg in its system environment, and it no longer supports the use of custom install scripts like .streamlit/setup.sh. While I included a bundled static FFmpeg binary in the project and updated the code to use it, Streamlit Cloud still fails to execute the binary due to file permission restrictions (+x not respected from Windows Git clients).

‚úÖ However:
The tool works fully and correctly in a local environment

Audio can be extracted from .mp4 and transcribed successfully

Whisper transcription and accent classification work as expected

The UI functions correctly via Streamlit when run locally
